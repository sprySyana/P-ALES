# Reflexions on the P-ALES project
In order to perfect the project, we must ask ourselves how to tacle the limitations that come with it. <br>
Here are some food for thoughts
## Color limitations
### For humans
Human eyes are limited in their perception of color nuances, if the colors choosen are too close they will be perceived similar.
Neuromarketing expert Diana Derval tested that limitatyion and her results are :
  - 25% of the population sees under 20 color nuances, they're dischromate
  - around 50% of the population sees between 20 and 32 nuances
  - few sees between 33 and 39 nuances thanks to aving 4 photoreceptors (blue, green, red and orange-red)
### For screens
Each screen will render colors slightly differently, modifing the color nuance perceived by both the students and the teachers
computer screen are also limited to a rendition of 35 nuances maximum.

Between the human and the screen limitation for color perception,
if we can't attribute a unique color to each phonem
we'll have to use other means to differenciate phonems
one idea is to layer a design on top of a color to signify a variation like nasalisation, aspiration ...
