# P-ALES
inspired by Kinephone, association colors-phonemes for sinogramic langages
## Project
The P-ALES project aims two objectives:
  the fist one is to associate phonemes to color like in the kinephone project
  the second is to use this color chart to help reader know how to prononce the sinograms (chinese ideograms)
to achieve the second goal, we will use a text already converted to API in entry
